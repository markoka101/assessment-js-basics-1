// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Mantain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the 
    Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const analysisofRequrements = "This is the second step, where you go through everything the client is looking for in the software";
const design = "This is the third step, where you figure out how to satisfy all the requirements in the software";
